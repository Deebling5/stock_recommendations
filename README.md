Recommendations scrapping script to fetch from Economic times. 
This app is deployed on Heroku. But anyone can host it on their own system. Just install the requirements and straight away run in terminal. 

It fetches first 45 recommendations which more less covers 2 days. You can obviously tweak this as per requirements.

Heroku visual dashboard is coming soon.
